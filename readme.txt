Import Notes:
This program must be run as an administrator for all of it's features to work properly.
This is still in it's very early stages of development, so keep in mind this is by no means finished.

Overview:
The purpose of this program is to automatically search a device for any Windows artifacts and then parse them. For each artifact, it will only parse the basic, but essential information in them. Think of it like a general overview of each artifact. This will make it so that even someone with nearly zero forensic knowledge can at least get a general idea of what is in each artifact without needing to know how to actually analyze those artifacts themselves. If this program returns information from an artifact that looks important, then it would be useful to use a tool that can do an in-depth analysis of that artifact to get more information.

Current Artifacts This Will Parse:
- Registry Artifacts:
	- SAM
	- SOFTWARE
	- SYSTEM
	- NTUSER.DAT
	- Amcache.hve

- LNK Files
	

More features coming soon.
